# The ELIXIR Maturity Model for Pathogen Data Platforms (PDP)

## Goals

The aim of this Maturity Model is to create a guide which can be used by technical decision makers to support the organisational data-sharing maturation strategy which they are tasked to execute. It should help bridge the gap between the goals of the high level decision makers and the actions of the technical implementers.
